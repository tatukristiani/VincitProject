# VincitProject
Vincits Rising Star Pre-Assignment project.

Project is written mostly in JavaScript with some little HTML and CSS.

# Files
BitcoinData.js = Class that holds date and price, so we can make it more pleasent to deal with CoinGeckos data.  
DateRangeBearish.js = Class that holds two BitcoinData objects, used when getting the Highest bearish(downward trend). Easier to compare.  
app.js = holds all the functions and intializations.  

# NOTE to Vincit personel who is reviewing this project
I'm better at using Java and at object oriented coding, I decided to make this project with JavaScript to rehers/remember my JavaScript and web creation skills.
